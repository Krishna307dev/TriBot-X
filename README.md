## ✨ Features

- **📱 Bluetooth Control:** Drive the robot manually using the custom Android app.
- **🛡️ Obstacle Avoidance:** Autonomous navigation avoiding collisions using ultrasonic and IR sensors.
- **🚶‍♂️ Human Following:** Automatically detects and follows a person or object in front of it.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is organized logically for both the hardware source and the Android control layer:

*The SVG version is available in the same folder for scalable viewing and editing.*

## 📱 Controller App

The custom Android app is designed specifically for this robot but is highly versatile. 

**Note: The app can be used individually for other microcontrollers!**
- It sends simple character commands via standard Serial over Bluetooth.
  - Examples: `M` for Manual mode, `Y` for Obstacle mode, `Z` for Follow mode.
- You can easily pair it with any HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth module connected to your own custom Arduino, ESP32, STM32, or Raspberry Pi Pico projects.
